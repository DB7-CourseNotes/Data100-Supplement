    "text": "Exercises\n\n1.2 First Steps\n\nHow many rows are in penguins? How many columns?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe? Read the help for ?penguins to find out.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nMake a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhy does the following give an error and how would you fix it?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nAdd the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint: Take a look at the documentation for labs().\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nRecreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should bill_depth_mm be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nRun this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions. (Note: ggplot2 accepts either “color” or “colour” as an argument. I am changing all instances to the Canadian spelling.)\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWill these two graphs look different? Why/why not?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.4 Visualizing distributions\n\nMake a bar plot of species of penguins, where you instead assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nHow are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, colour or fill, is more useful for changing the colour of bars?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nMake a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the ggplot2 package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.5.5 Visualizing Relationships\n\nThe mpg data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains 234 observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 car models. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run mpg?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nMake a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ using the mpg data frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to colour, then size, then both colour and size, then shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?\nIn the scatterplot of hwy vs. displ, what happens if you map a third variable to linewidth?\nWhat happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nMake a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm and colour the points by species. What does adding colouring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables? What about faceting by species?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhy does the following yield two separate legends? How would you fix it to combine the two legends?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nCreate the two following stacked bar plots. Which question can you answer with the first one? Which question can you answer with the second one?\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",
