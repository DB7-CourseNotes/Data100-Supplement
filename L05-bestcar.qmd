Suppose I want to buy a car and fuel efficiency is my main concern. Also suppose that it's 2008 and electric cars aren't yet a thing. What should I look for when I go to a dealership?

Use the following code cells to use the code we've learned to:

- Find the class/drv/fuel type/etc. that has the best fuel efficiency.
- Demonstrate this with a relevant plot.

Note: Because this is "`webr`", you *do not* need to install or load any packages. `dplyr` and `ggplot2` are already loaded in the background.

```{webr-r}
# Use this code cell to find the best car for fuel efficiency!
```


```{webr-r}
# Use this code cell to make a relevant plot!
```
