### Recap

We need to run `install.packages("tidyverse")` **once**, then we load the package every time we start R:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We worked with the `mpg` data, which is built into `ggplot2`, which is a package that you get when you install `tidyverse`:

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```

-   `mpg` is the box that holds the data.

-   `displ`, `hwy`, and `drv` are examples of columns within the data. R can't find these unless you tell it to look inside `mpg`.

We also worked with the `palmerpenguins` data, but we're switching to `mpg` for this lesson.

We slowly built up something like the following ggplot (note that I've made it a little bit better):

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = factor(drv)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
    labs(
        x = "Engine Displacement",
        y = "Highway Fuel Efficiency",
        colour = "Drivetrain",
        title = "Efficiency versus Engine Size",
        subtitle = "As size increase, efficiency tends to decrease"
    ) +
    theme_bw()
    
```

### `facet_wrap()` with respect to a variable

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv)) +
    facet_wrap(~ cyl) +
    theme_bw()
```

Why is there a `~` before the column name? It's complicated, but here's a simplified version:

-   The name `cyl` is part of the `mpg` dataframe. It doesn't exist outside `mpg`.
-   The `~` makes it a special kind of object called a **formula**. R won't search for things in the formula until later.
-   `facet_wrap()` will tell R to look for `cyl` only when it needs to, and will direct it to the `mpg` dataframe.

### `facet_grid()` with respect to two variables

This generates a grid of plots, labelled across columns and rows by the values in the respective variable

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))+
    facet_grid(rows = vars(drv), cols = vars(cyl)) +
    #facet_grid() +
    theme_bw()
```

### Try out on your own

-   Use `facet_grid(. ~ cyl)` or `facet_grid(drv ~ .)` in the last code snippet to see what happens.
-   Compare `facet_grid(. ~ cyl)` and `facet_wrap(~ cyl)`.
-   With the various choices of `facet_grid()` in the last code snippet, try add `colour` representing `class` to the plot, and see if more information can be extracted just by looking.

### More scatter plots

General structure of `ggplot` calls:

`ggplot(data = DATA) + GEOM_FUNCTION(mapping = aes(MAPPINGS))`

The same scatter plot of `hwy` (highway mileage) v.s. `displ` (engine size)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    theme_bw()
```

-   We'll use this as a basis.
    -   Follow along in RStudio!

### Including the `cty` (in-town mileage) variable

-   Decorate the points differently according to its `cty` value, using one of the `aesthetics`.
    -   Try `colour`, `shape`, `alpha` (shading), `size`

```{r}
# comment / uncomment the appropriate lines to test the corresponding aesthetics
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    theme_bw() +
    # what's the difference with `colour = class`
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, colour = cty))
    # would it work?
    #geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, shape = cty))
    # how does this compare with `colour = cty`?
    #geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, alpha = cty))
    # talking about intuitive
    #geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, size = cty), alpha=0.3)
```

Try out `shape` for the `drv` (drive train)

-   overlapping points become evident
-   use `xlim()` and `ylim()` to scale the part of plots for more details

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, shape = drv)) +
  ylim(10,20) +
  xlim(5,6)
```

We can also try to `facet_` it

```{r}
# comment / uncomment the appropriate lines to test the corresponding aesthetics
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, shape = drv)) +
  facet_wrap(~ drv)       # it works
  #facet_grid(drv ~ .)     # this way seems to be better
  #facet_wrap(drv ~ .)       # could this work as well?
```

Can change overall aesthetics as well. Combination of effects can be very fancy

**Caution**: could go too far and end up with too much to handle

```{r}
# comment / uncomment the appropriate lines to test the corresponding aesthetics
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, shape = drv), colour='blue')
  #geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, shape = drv), size=3, alpha=0.3)
  #geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, colour = drv, fill=class), size=3, alpha=0.5, shape=21)
```

**Question**: What about overlapping points (*overplot*)?

-   `jitter` them, with the `position` parameter
-   or use `geom_jitter` directly
    -   Rerun the code block to see that `jittering` really is *random*
    -   Do not over-use `geom_jitter` unless it is necessary

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  #geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, alpha = cty), position='jitter')
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, alpha = cty))
```

### Use `geom_smooth`

There are different ways to present data graphically.

Each function in the `geom_` family of functions in `ggplot2` is suitable in displaying some statistical property or properties. For instance

-   `geom_point` gives raw concept of how data look like
-   `geom_smooth` does statistics in the backstage, and outputs a *smooth* curve
    -   illustrating trends, but can also be misleading taken alone

```{r}
# Did this before, here with jittering
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

**Comment**: Good coding style: *try not repeat*. The following is good, since it reduces repetition while achieving the same effects as above. Can do this because `ggplot` and `geom_` functions are implemented this way.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_jitter()
```

Aesthetics for `geom_smooth`

-   `group` data points by values in a `categorical` variable, and do stats separately to generate separate curves
-   `linetype`, similar to `group` and changes the type of line used
-   `colour`, similar to `group` and changes the colour of line used

**Caution**: Could end up with too much to handle

```{r}
# comment / uncomment the appropriate lines to test the corresponding aesthetics
ggplot(data=mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) +
  #geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = drv)) #+
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_jitter(aes(size = cty), alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~drv)
  #facet_grid(drv~.)
```

If only want the smooth line (without the shades) can use `se=FALSE`

-   this gets rid of the shades around the curve, which represents the uncertainty of the estimates
-   more precisely, it relates to the notion of `confidence interval` -- which will be in your stats course

Use `?geom_smooth` in `Console` to see more details.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) +
  #geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), se=FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(mapping=aes(colour=drv))
```
