# Data Visualization

```{webr-r}
#| label: setup
#| context: setup

q1_check <- function() {
  if (!exists("penguin_point")) {
    error("The object \"penguin_point\" has not been created.")
  }
  ifelse(length(penguin_point$layers) > 0,
    yes = ifelse("GeomPoint" %in% class(penguin_point$layers[[1]]$geom),
      yes = "Test Passed :)\n",
      no = "No points found.\n"),
    no = "No layers added.\n") |>
    cat()
}
```

## Exploring the `penguins`

```{webr-r}
#| label: 
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)

glimpse(penguins)
```

## Adding to a `ggplot` object

**Add** points to the following plot. The `q1_check()` function will tell you if you've done it right. 

Note that there are parentheses "()" around the creation of ggplot object. We'll talk about why this is in class. In short, it's a technical reason that's outside of the scope of the course but helps with grading things.

```{webr-r}
#| label: building
library(ggplot2)

(penguin_point <- ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  # YOUR SOLUTION HERE
)

q1_check()
```
